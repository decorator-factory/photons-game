# photons-game

A sandbox game I had the misfortune to write in `python`+`tkinter` (I thought it was a good idea).

In this game you can place different blocks that work with light beams: lasers, mirrors, lasers, filters etc.

Technically this game is Turing complete: you can make a NAND gate and a NOR gate.

Run `phoEdit.py` to create and edit levels and `phoSim.py` to simulate (run) levels.

Unfortunately, there is no documentation for the editor because the game was written a while ago and needs to reconsider its life choices. You can still try to make some levels.
